# Stopwatch-App

## I designed a stopwatch using the fundamental web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This dynamic stopwatch allows users to start and stop the timer at their convenience, providing precise timekeeping. Users can record laps while the stopwatch is running and clear all recorded laps with a single click.
